##Wants: 
• keyboard navigation 
• 
• 


##Stretch goals
• Clickable/keyboard controls to move and rotate object
• 
• 
• 



##Concerns to tackle from Sketchfab integration:
• No movement of object with keyboard when in orbit mode, and limited movement in first-person mode
• Tab focus only visible on top left two elements
• Tab interactivity is spotty, and only works for some buttons. It’s hard to tell which without a visual indication, and the functionality seems to be spotty, as I’m not getting the same results as just clicking on the buttons
• No screen reader description (known)
•The bottom of the I-Frame is cut off when viewed in fullscreen at 200%

##Features
• Import data (images and controls) from json files
